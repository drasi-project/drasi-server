# HTTP Source - Webhook Receiver
# =============================================================================
#
# The HTTP source creates an HTTP endpoint that receives data via POST requests.
# Use this when you need to:
# - Receive webhooks from external services
# - Ingest data from REST APIs that push updates
# - Build event-driven pipelines from HTTP sources
#
# Configuration options:
# - host: Address to bind (default: 0.0.0.0)
# - port: Port to listen on (required)
# - endpoint: Custom endpoint path (optional)
# - timeout_ms: Request timeout in milliseconds (default: 10000)
#
# Run with: cargo run -- --config examples/configs/02-sources/http-webhook-receiver.yaml
#
# Then send data with:
#   curl -X POST http://localhost:9000 \
#     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
#     -d '{"id": "event-1", "type": "order", "amount": 100}'
